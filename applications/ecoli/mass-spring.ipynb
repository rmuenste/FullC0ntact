    "To control anisotropy several axes of mechanical anisotropy in the barycenter of each volume element of the mesh are generated. Forces generated due to the deformation of the model will act only i nthe direction of these axes. For examples, to model the mechanical deformation of a muscle, the direction of anisotropy axes mush be set in the direction of the fibers of the muscle in each of the volume elements of the model's mesh. Although the method allows the definition of several axes of anisotropy, only three were defined in each of volume elements. This was enough to model the anisotropic mechanical behavior of all types of materials modeled with the developed framework."

    "In a volume element, each axis interscts with the faces of that element in two points, called intersection points. During deformation, the axes evolve with the volume elements to which they belong. At any given moment t, the orientation of an axis  $\\zeta_1$ in a volume element $\\mathcal{V}_k$ can be determined using the line extended between the pair of intersection points the axis defines. This can be done numerically by calculating the vector between the pair $(q_{2l}, q_{2l+1})$ regardless of its direction.
